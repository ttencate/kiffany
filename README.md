An experimental voxel engine, reminiscent of a certain mining game.

It's called Kiffany because a previous procedural terrain engine I worked on
was called Wafflehouse. Makes sense, doesn't it?

I wrote this back in 2012, and updated in 2015 to make it compile again.
However, it seems to freeze on startup and I have no time to debug it further.
